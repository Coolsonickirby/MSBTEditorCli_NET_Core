<h1>MSBTEditorCli</h1>
<hr>
<p>Credits all due to <a href="https://github.com/IcySon55/">IcySon55</a> and <a href="https://github.com/exelix11/">exelix11</a> for the original MSBT source code, all I did was rework it to make it export MSBTs as JSON and vice-versa because there was nothing I could find that does that.</p>
<h4>Usage:</h4>
<h5 style="font-style: italic;">MSBTEditorCli.exe [INPUT FILE] [OUTPUT FILE]</h5>
<p>Decided to archive the old repo since I found out I did all the work with .NET Framework instead of .NET Core</p>
